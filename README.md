**MNIST Interactive Website (NOT OFFICIAL)** <br>
A basic website designed to be interactive to guage the level of overfitting from the models I have trained. <br>
The matrixinfo.json contains all the weight/bias parameters that are trained in my MNISTneuralnetwork model. <br>
Currently still trying to see how many epochs is best to prevent overfitting but maintaing accuracy.
